## Brand & Style

This design system is engineered to evoke the feeling of high-precision aerospace instrumentation and advanced optical
technology. The brand personality is technical, expert-oriented, and immersive, targeting professional creators and tech
enthusiasts who demand granular control over their imagery.

The aesthetic utilizes a sophisticated **Glassmorphism** style layered over a deep-space environment. It blends a "
Tech-Noir" atmosphere with high-visibility neon accents. Visual depth is achieved through translucent panels and subtle
background grid patterns that suggest an underlying digital architecture, creating an interface that feels like a
head-up display (HUD) rather than a traditional mobile app.

## Colors

The palette is anchored by a deep, dark blue foundation that provides maximum contrast for the camera's viewfinder.

* **Primary (Neon Cyan):** Used for active states, critical focus indicators, and primary action buttons. It represents
  precision and clarity.
* **Secondary (Electric Purple):** Used for creative modes, secondary adjustments, and decorative flourishes to add
  depth and a futuristic edge.
* **Tertiary (Slate Blue):** Used for glass panel backgrounds and low-priority containers to distinguish UI layers from
  the pitch-black background.
* **Glows:** Neon colors should employ a soft outer glow (0 0 10px) with 40-60% opacity to simulate light emission on
  the glass surfaces.

## Typography

The typography leverages **Space Grotesk** to achieve a clean, geometric, and cutting-edge look. The design system
treats text as technical data.

Headlines are bold and tight to convey authority. For camera readouts (ISO, Shutter, Aperture), use the "readout-lg"
style with increased letter spacing to mimic monospaced hardware displays. Labels should frequently use uppercase
transforms and wide tracking to maintain a technical "blueprint" aesthetic. All numerical data should be presented with
tabular lining where possible to ensure alignment during real-time value changes.

## Layout & Spacing

The layout follows a **fluid grid** model optimized for edge-to-edge camera previews. Critical controls are anchored to
the corners and sides to keep the center of the frame clear.

A 4px base unit governs all spatial relationships. UI panels use a 16px gutter between elements to maintain a
technical, "exploded view" feel. Sidebars and control clusters are padded 24px from the screen edge to account for thumb
ergonomics and device bezels. Subtle, low-opacity grid lines (10% opacity Neon Cyan) should be overlaid behind menus to
reinforce the high-tech structural theme.

## Elevation & Depth

Elevation in this design system is conveyed through **Glassmorphism** and light emission rather than traditional
shadows.

1. **Base Layer:** The camera viewfinder or the deep dark blue background.
2. **Middle Layer:** Glass panels with a 20px-40px backdrop blur and a semi-transparent fill (8% white or tertiary
   blue). These panels feature a 1px inner stroke in white (15% opacity) to define edges.
3. **Top Layer:** Floating controls and active indicators. These elements emit a neon glow, creating a "Z-axis" depth
   that feels like the interface is projected toward the user.

Shadows are replaced by tinted "ambient glows" beneath active panels, using the primary or secondary color at 5% opacity
with a large (40px) blur.

## Shapes

The design system uses a **Rounded** shape language to balance the aggressive technicality of the typography with a
modern, premium feel.

Standard UI panels and buttons use a 0.5rem (8px) corner radius. Larger container overlays use 1.5rem (24px) to create a
softer frame around the camera content. Small indicators (like focus points or active chips) may use a "soft" 0.25rem
radius for a precision-tool look. The interaction of rounded glass panels against the rigid grid pattern creates the
distinct high-tech aesthetic.

## Components

* **Glass Buttons:** Semi-transparent containers with 1px neon borders. On press, the background fill opacity increases,
  and the neon glow intensifies.
* **Technical Chips:** Small, pill-shaped or slightly rounded readouts for metadata (e.g., "4K", "60FPS"). Use the
  `label-caps` typography style.
* **Precision Sliders:** Thin tracks (2px) with a glowing circular thumb. The track "fills" with a neon gradient from
  Cyan to Purple as it increases.
* **Segmented Controls:** Used for mode switching (Photo, Video, Pro). Active states are indicated by a neon underline
  or a glass-morphed "floating" background selector.
* **HUD Overlays:** Crosshairs, histograms, and level indicators should use ultra-thin 1px lines in Neon Cyan with no
  fills to maximize visibility of the image behind them.
* **Expansion Panels:** Vertically stacking glass drawers for advanced settings like White Balance or Focus Peaking,
  using subtle grid separators between rows.
